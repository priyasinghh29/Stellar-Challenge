    <h1>ACADEMIC VALIDATION</h1>

     <h3>What it means?</h3> 
     <p>Academic validation  can be described as "relating oneâ€™s self-worth to its grades." <br>
        It can even be described as an addiction, when a person's only identity becomes their performance<br> at school and whether their educators congratulate them for it or not. <br>
        While academic validation is a good motivator in some cases, striving excessively for success may<br> harm your mental health enormously.
       <br>
        How many times did your class clap for an exceptional student who happened to present a<br> "perfect" presentation?<br> 
        How many times have parents praised their children for getting amazing test scores?<br>
        While these words can be satisfying for just a minute, people do not realize the amount of work this<br> student has done to achieve these 100s.<br> 
        After each clap and every pleasing word, children start to base their entire self-worth on academic<br> achievements and feel like a failure when they don't exceed their expectations.<br>

  <h8>The Harmful Side-effects Behind Academic Validation</h8>
    <p>Comprehensive research has revealed that a significant number of secondary school and higher education students experience excessive stress <br>related to academic demands. This stress arises from various factors, including the pressure to perform well in tests and exams, meet assignment<br> deadlines, and excel in extracurricular activities.
        The negative effects of academic stress extend beyond the classroom, leading to other mental<br> health problems such as depression and anxiety. Other physical symptoms such as sleep disturbances and substance use, highlight the harmful<br> effects of academic stress on students' overall health and well-being.
